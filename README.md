# PyBer Analysis


## Overview:
We will be visualizing ride-sharing data from PyBer by creating charts using Pandas library and Matplotlib. The charts will tell us  differences and trends between the “type” of city, the number of drivers and riders, and the percentage of “total fares”, “riders”, and “drivers” by “type” of city. We would like to help PyBer by giving them the charts to determine affordability for neighborhoods and availability for ride-sharing services.

## Results:

•	In this scatter plot image we can see the correlation between the size of the bubble and driver count per city. The average fare in “Urban” type settings was a good amount less than “Suburban” setting, and a great deal less than the “Rural” setting.

* Here in this box and whisker plot image we can see the number of rides in our 3 city types. The number rides was much higher in an “Urban” setting with the average number of rides quadrupling the “Rural” setting.

•	In this boxplot image we see the average ”Urban” fare was less than both the “Suburban” and “Rural” city types.

* This pie chart image shows the percentage of total rides by city type. The “Urban” type had, by far the highest total ride percentage.

* With this pie chart we can see the percentage of total drivers by city type. Again, the amount of “Urban” drivers is greatly higher than the other two city types.

* This multiple line chart shows the change in fare by month. There was a spike in late February of 2019 in the ”Suburban” setting, while the “Rural” setting pretty much stayed consistent throughout.

## Summary
 Based on the results, we can see that the majority of drivers and riders are in an “Urban” setting. The cost is lower in “Urban” settings as well. I believe that correlates to the driving distance and population density. The more people in a closer proximity, such as a big city, the more rides you will get. The closer proximity can also explain the lower cost per fare because you are not driving as far. 
  In the charts, we saw that the percentage of drivers did not match the percentage of rides in the “Urban” setting. This tells me that there could be more efficient measures taken. Possibly hiring more drivers in the “Suburban and “Rural settings to accommodate the rider need.
 In the multiple line chart, the suburban fares at the end of February jumps out at me. I can think of no reason why fares would be higher during that time. I recommend putting resources into that field to determine why.
 In the “Rural” setting, fares were higher than the other two city types. Possibly due to the distance per ride. The more spread out the community, the farther you would have to travel. Another idea would be to give a rider discount to “Rural” riders to keep customer morale high.
